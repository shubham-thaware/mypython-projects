# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

#       It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

#     Under 18.5 they are underweight
#     Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#     Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#     Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#     Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# BMI Formula
# BMI = weight(kg)/height^2(m^2)

# Important: you do not need to round the result to the nearest whole number. It's fine to print out a floating point number for this exercise. The interpretation message needs to include the words from the interpretations above. e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.
# Example Input 1

# 1.50
# 63

# Example Output 1

# Your BMI is 28.0, you are slightly overweight.

# since 63 Ã· (1.50 x 1.50) = 28

# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

# "Your BMI is 18.28678, you are underweight."
# "Your BMI is 22.0, you have a normal weight."
# "Your BMI is 28.50752, you are slightly overweight."
# "Your BMI is 32.56189, you are obese."
# "Your BMI is 37.50000, you are clinically obese."

# Example Input 2

# 1.60
# 96

# Example Output 2

# Your BMI is 37.49999999999999, you are clinically obese.

# Example Input 3

# 1.71
# 73

# Example Output 3

# Your BMI is 24.96494647925858, you have a normal weight.






# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters -----> "))
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
